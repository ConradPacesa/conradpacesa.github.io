## My Journey Into Development

I wanted to write this blog post chronicling my decision to begin learning how to code and my journey so far.

First let's start with a little background. When I started University I didn't know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I decided to study business since I figured it would give me something practical to fall back on if I didn't figure it out in four years. Two years in I decided a career in finance appealed to me, I enjoyed working with numbers to solve large problems logically and finance offered that to me.

After I graduated University, my first experience in the real world was an unpaid internship at a small private equity firm. My favorite part about the job was building financial models in Excel, with complex formulas and multiple dependencies. As my analysis got deeper, my models got more complex, eventually to the point where I even started to write my own macros.

Our firm worked with tech companies quite a bit where I learned a lot about the industry. I became really interested in the tech industry and decided to change career oaths. Since I had no real technical skills at that point in time, I figured the best way to break in was by landing a sales role.

My first real (paying) job out of school was in sales at an IT systems integrator. This role was a great opportunity to learn all about the cutting edge in enterprise technology. While I definitely did enjoy working in the tech industry, I did miss the complex problem solving that I enjoyed while working in finance.

In my spare time after work I tried to learn how to develop by using some of the many courses available online for free. Although there are many great resources out there, I had a tough time retaining anything I was learning, nor was I gaining a deep understanding of the code. At around this point, I began to look into attending a coding boot camp. Although I had been well aware of coding boot-camps at this point, I knew they were very expensive (not to mention intense) I wanted to give it a go on my own first and see if I could learn for free at my own pace. After reading testimonials from people who had enrolled at Bloc, I noticed that many people were facing struggles similar to my own. They hat tried to learn to code on their own, but it wasn't until they had all of the resources provided by Bloc that they were actually able to truly learn to code.

After doing quite some research, I ultimately decided to enroll at Bloc. I will go into greater detail on my experiences at Bloc so far in my next post.

Stay tuned!
