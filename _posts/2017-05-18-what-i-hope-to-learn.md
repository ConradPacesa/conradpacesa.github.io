## What I Hope to Learn at Bloc

This is a quick post outlining what I am hoping to learn in my time at Bloc. First let's go over what I am learning in detail.

The software developer track at Bloc consists of 6 modules. The first one, which I had already completed was the "prework" portion of the boot camp. I learned the very basics of programming in order to begin the real work. The section I am finishing right now is the front-end portion of course, where I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with jQuery and AngularJS to build the front-end portion of a web application. Up next will be the back-end portion of the course, where I will learn Ruby-on-Rails to build the back-end services for my apps. The fourth module is the project specialization, where I will build two complete applications form start to finish using the languages and frameworks I had learned. In the fifth module, I will take a deep dive into software engineering principles, where I will learn about data structures and algorithms, databases as well as framework architecture and design patterns. Finally, I will create and contribute what I had learned to open source projects.

Of course I expect to learn how code and build applications, those are table stakes when it comes to coding boot-camps. What I am really hoping to get out of Bloc is a much deeper understanding of the software development process than the typical boot-camp graduate. The fifth module in the software development track is how I am hoping to achieve this, by learning in-depth about the software engineering principals that go into a making a decision about which algorithms, languages and frameworks to use. This will help me as I grow in my career and begin managing people and projects, having to make decisions about software architecture, languages and design.
