title: My Experience at Bloc

## What is Bloc?

Bloc is a coding boot camp offered entirely remotely. They offer courses in web design, web development and software development either full-time or part-time. Each student at Bloc is paired one-to-one with a mentor who is responsible for their students success with a deep understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. This allows Bloc to custom tailor the course for each student, focusing on their education on areas where improvement is required and their goals they hope to achieve.

## Why I Chose Bloc

I chose Bloc for two primary reasons. The first is the flexibility of the schedule, allowing me to learn to code in my spare time while working. The second is the one-to-one support from my Bloc mentor. Most coding boot-camps are intensive ~10-20 week programs where you're forced to quit your job and dedicate pretty much 100% of your time to learning to code for several months. Bloc allowed me to continue working while learning, allowing me to continue earning money to pay for classes as well as wait until I was prepared before pulling the trigger on a career change.

Perhaps my favorite thing about Bloc is the one-on-one support I receive from my mentor. From the beginning of the program, I am paired with a mentor, who is there to help me grow and develop as a software developer. Every time we meet I bring with me a list of questions and concepts that I am struggling to understand which we go over in detail to ensure I understand the concepts. Because of the close mentor-student relationship at Bloc, mentors have a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their students and are quickly able to help them out with the issues they are having to help them move forward with their learning.

## My Experiences So far

My experience with Bloc has far exceeded my expectations thus far. When signing up I never imagined that I would be able to learn and accomplish as much as I after programming for such a short amount of time. I have access to a knowledgeable mentor who is able to help me out whenever I get stuck on a problem that I can't seem to find a Solution to. Working in this way has often given us the opportunity to take a deep dive into the concepts as well as the code, helping me get a deeper understanding of how and why a particular piece of code works.

I have also found it very beneficial to receive feedback about the code I write. Often times, while the implementation I chose works, as the app scales or new features are added the implementation I decided to go with may cause problems in the future. Having someone to point out these issues before they occur and show me best practices to build features correctly the first time has saved me a lot of headache in addition to teaching me industry best practices used to develop bug-free and scalable applications.

My journey from here will be heading into back-end development using Ruby on Rails. I'm looking forward to learning more with Bloc.
