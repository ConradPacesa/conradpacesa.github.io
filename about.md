My name is Conrad Pacesa, I live in Toronto, Canada and graduated from Brock University in 2015. I am enrolled in the software developer program at Bloc, where I am learning how to build web applications. Among the technologies I am learning are AngularJS, jQuery and Ruby on Rails. I have so far built my first two applications, a music player and a chat app with more to come.
